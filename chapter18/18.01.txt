Exercise 18.1: What is the type of the exception object in the following throws?

	(a) range_error r("error"); (b) exception *p = &r;
		throw r;					throw *p;

What would happen if the throw in (b) were written as throw p?

By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) range_error
(b) exception

If b were written as throw p, the type would be "pointer to an exception", i.e.
exception *. This could lead to an error if r is destroyed before a catch
handler is matched with the thrown object during the stack unwiding process.
(p. 774)
