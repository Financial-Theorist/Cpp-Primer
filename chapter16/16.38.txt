Exercise 16.38: When we call make_shared (ยง 12.1.1, p. 451), we have to provide
an explicit template argument. Explain why that argument is needed and how it
is used.

By Faisal Saadatmand

make_shared function return type is shared_ptr, which differs from its
parameter type. Therefore, its return type cannot be deduced from the
function's arguments and must be provide as explicit template argument.
